  <h1>No geographic information</h1>
  No map can be shown with the geographic location of all teams and how these are geographically divided into poules. <br/>
  This can be enabled by supplying an input file with the latitude/longitude information on all sporthalls where the teams are playing.<br/>
  <br/>
  Without this geographic information, the distances between sporthalls cannot be calculated and the functionality to optimally divide teams over poules based on the distance cannot be used.
